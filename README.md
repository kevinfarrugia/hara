# HAR Analyzer

**HAR A**nalyzer is a Node.js-based tool for performing simple analysis on HTTP Archive (.har) files.

## Why?

HAR (HTTP Archive) files are generated by the browser or [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org) containing timing information for each page and resource requested during the captured session. HAR Analyzer aggregates & formats this data to return timing information for each request type and allow you to identify performance bottlenecks or issues.

## Installation

```sh
npm -g install hara
```

or

```sh
yarn global add hara
```

## CLI usage

```sh
hara one.har two.har -o one.json two.json
```

As a CSV file using `--csv`/`-c` flag:

```sh
hara one.har --csv
```

Or use the `--folder`/`-f` flag to process a whole folder of SVG icons

```sh
hara -f ./path/to/input/ -o ./path/to/output/
```

See help for advanced usage

```sh
hara --help
```
